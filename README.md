## Peace Corps Opportunities Interface
#### A transparent volunteer placement system.

This Rails app allows applicants to browse over 4,000 volunteer opportunities and apply for the position that best fits their skills, interests, and medical needs. Currently, individuals apply to a general pool and are contacted by a centralized placement team at Peace Corps with an available opportunity. The process can be slow and vague, which causes both top candidates to withdraw their application and placed volunteers to misunderstand the position's expectations. The Opportunities Interface will allow interested applicants to read detailed descriptions of projects, living conditions, and skills needed, as well as read experiences directly from past participants to fully understand a project and essentially place themselves.
